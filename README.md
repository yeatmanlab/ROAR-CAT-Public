# ROAR-CAT: Rapid Online Assessment of Reading Abilities
The Rapid Online Assessment of Reading (ROAR) is a web-based, lexical decision task that measures single word reading abilities in children and adults without a proctor. Here we study whether item response theory (IRT) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) can be used to create a more efficient online measure of word recognition.

This repo contains data analysis of ROAR-CAT.
