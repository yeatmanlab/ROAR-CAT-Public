# ROAR-CAT: Rapid Online Assessment of Reading ability with Computerized Adaptive Testing
The Rapid Online Assessment of Reading (ROAR) is a web-based, lexical decision task that measures single word reading abilities in children and adults without a proctor. Here we study whether item response theory (IRT) and computerized adaptive testing (CAT) can be used to create a more efficient online measure of word recognition.

This repo contains data analysis and figures in the manuscript of ROAR-CAT. 

## Analysis
Study 1: parameter_invariance.Rmd\
Study 2: cat_validation.Rmd\
Study 3: roar-convergent-validity.Rmd

## Code availability
